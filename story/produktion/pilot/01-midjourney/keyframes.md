## SHOT 24 -- Kids Augen (ECU Erkennung)
Quelle: drehbuch.md -> Beat 6 -> Shot 24
Timeline: 3:01 - 3:04
Emotion: Geheimnis, zehn Jahre in einem Blick

```
semi-realistic anime style, extreme close-up, static sharp composition on eyes only,
deep-set dark gray-green eyes with prominent crow's feet like dry riverbeds, weathered skin around eyes, silver-gray hair visible at temples in periphery,
the eyes looking at something specific with a micro-twitch of recognition, a flash of moisture in the eyes for one millisecond then control returning, ten years of weight visible in the gaze,
warm white light from front with subtle cyan shimmer reflecting from a nearby screen on left side,
recognition and controlled emotion atmosphere with deep secret and restrained feeling,
--niji 7 --sref 205189384 --ar 16:9 --s 250 --style raw
--no photorealistic, hyperrealistic, chibi, oversized eyes, clean new clothing, fantasy, magic, glowing aura, holographic displays, floating UI, 3D render, CGI, bright saturated colors, pristine surfaces, sunlight

## SHOT 25 -- Ios Reaktion auf Kid (CU)
Quelle: drehbuch.md -> Beat 6 -> Shot 25
Timeline: 3:04 - 3:07
Emotion: Annahme, vorsichtig, zerbrechlich

```
semi-realistic anime style, close-up portrait, static composition,
young male 17yo face in warm white light, lean face with sharp cheekbones, crooked nose, dark brown almond eyes with dark circles, messy black mid-length hair, olive-brown skin in warm soft tones,
expression showing the smallest degree of relaxation like a fist opening one millimeter, a tiny almost invisible nod, eyes softening for the first time in the entire scene not fully but one degree of guard lowered,
warm white soft light on face, gentle and transformative,
fragile acceptance atmosphere with cautious trust forming for the first time in years,
--niji 7 --sref 205189384 --ar 2:3 --s 250 --style raw
--no photorealistic, hyperrealistic, chibi, oversized eyes, clean new clothing, fantasy, magic, glowing aura, holographic displays, floating UI, 3D render, CGI, bright saturated colors, pristine surfaces, sunlight

## SHOT 26 -- Kid dreht sich um (FB von hinten)
Quelle: drehbuch.md -> Beat 6 -> Shot 26
Timeline: 3:07 - 3:10
Emotion: Vertrauen, das Schiff weiss es schon

```
semi-realistic anime style, full body shot, static camera as figure walks away,
broad massive male early 40s seen from behind walking down warm-lit ship corridor, dark anthracite heavy clothing, imposing wide shoulders, silver-gray hair at temples, heavy confident rhythmic steps, black titanium ring on right hand catching a brief cyan light flash,
on the corridor wall he passes an embedded screen showing a branching code tree with a new branch just appearing at the edge,
warm white ambient light with cyan screen accents in the corridor,
trust and invitation atmosphere with quiet authority and the ship already knowing,
--niji 7 --sref 205189384 --ar 16:9 --s 250 --style raw
--no photorealistic, hyperrealistic, chibi, oversized eyes, clean new clothing, fantasy, magic, glowing aura, holographic displays, floating UI, 3D render, CGI, bright saturated colors, pristine surfaces, sunlight

## SHOT 27 -- Titel Card (Graphic)
Quelle: drehbuch.md -> Beat 6 -> Shot 27
Timeline: 3:10 - 3:17
Emotion: Die Reise beginnt

```
semi-realistic anime style, title card graphic composition centered on black,
pure black background, the text N E U E  W E L T in white typography with slight texture and minimal cyan accent highlights on letter edges, below it smaller the text Playbook V0,
the typography style matches an ancient colony script angular and purposeful, white letters on deep black with faint cyan edge glow,
black on black with only the title glowing in off-white and minimal cyan,
mysterious promise atmosphere of a journey just beginning,
--niji 7 --sref 205189384 --ar 16:9 --s 250 --style raw
--no photorealistic, hyperrealistic, chibi, oversized eyes, clean new clothing, fantasy, magic, glowing aura, holographic displays, floating UI, 3D render, CGI, bright saturated colors, pristine surfaces, sunlight
